## Description
In this week's Challenge I created a backend application using sequelize and Node.js in order to 
create, seed, and maintain a backend relational database to track products and associated categories and tags.

## User-Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```


## Acceptance-Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Installation
To get the app running, first you must `npm i`, then run the `schema.sql` and go to seeds folder and run `index.js` to get the database started and populated.

After this you can fire up the server and go to insomnia to check different CRUD operations on the backend.


## Usage
This app allows the user to create new Categories, products, and tags for each product. Additionally, it allows the user to 
perform CRUD operation on the backend.
